          <p>I am a 37 year old Full-stack developer with over 18 years of professional experience, a veteran of the United States Air Force, Husband, and Father.</p>
          <p>
            After graduating from a vacational highschool with a focused study on internet technologies, I immediately began my professional career. However, 
            during the recession in 2009, I made the decision to serve the country and joined the United States Air Force assuming the career field my father 
            occupied while he served, Fuels & Cryogentics Specialist (2F0X1).
          </p>
            
            While in active duty, I continued to hone my development skills as a free-lance developer, until I left active duty in 2014 and switched to reserve duty. During that time, I resumed the full-time profession of a full stack developer. I was honorably discharged from service in 2018 after I met my, soon-to-be wife Mallory.
            
            2 years later, Mallory and I were married, and shortly after became the proud parents of a baby boy named, Tyr.</p>
